# Autonomous Agent Pattern

## Pattern Overview

The Autonomous Agent pattern features an LLM that dynamically directs its own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how it accomplishes tasks through an iterative reasoning-action-observation loop.

## Use Cases

- **Travel Planning**: Gathering information and providing personalized recommendations
- **Customer Support**: Resolving complex issues through information gathering and problem-solving
- **Research Assistant**: Finding and synthesizing information from multiple sources
- **Software Development**: Debugging and fixing issues across codebases
- **Personal Assistant**: Handling scheduling, reminders, and information lookup tasks

## Dapr Agent Implementation

This example demonstrates a simple travel assistant that:
1. Takes a travel query as input
2. Uses the ReAct (Reasoning-Action) framework to determine what information is needed
3. Dynamically decides which tools to call and in what order
4. Synthesizes gathered information into a comprehensive response

## Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment 
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Create .env file with your API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

Run the example:

```bash
# Run with Dapr
dapr run --app-id agent --resources-path components/ -- python 08_agent.py
```

## How It Works

The key components of this Autonomous Agent pattern implementation are:

1. **ReAct Framework**: The agent follows a structured Reasoning-Action-Observation loop:
   - **Thought**: The agent reasons about what information is needed
   - **Action**: The agent calls a tool to gather information
   - **Observation**: The agent processes the tool's response
   - **Repeat**: The cycle continues until sufficient information is gathered

2. **Tool Integration**: The agent has access to simple tools:
   - Weather information for cities
   - Activity recommendations for popular destinations

3. **Self-Directed Process**: Unlike other patterns, the agent itself decides:
   - Which tools to use
   - In what order to call them
   - When it has sufficient information to respond

This implementation demonstrates the core value of the Autonomous Agent pattern: enabling dynamic, adaptive problem-solving without predefined workflows.

## When to Use This Pattern

This pattern is ideal when:
- Tasks require sequentially dependent steps
- Tool usage decisions depend on previous observations
- The workflow can't be predetermined
- Human intervention should be minimized
- Adaptability to changing circumstances is required

## Key Benefits

- Provides flexibility to handle diverse inputs
- Adapts approach based on gathered information
- Makes tool usage decisions dynamically
- Mimics human reasoning and problem-solving
- Requires minimal external orchestration
